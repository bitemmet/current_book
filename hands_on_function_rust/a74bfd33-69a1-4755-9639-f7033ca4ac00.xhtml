<p>In this chapter, we outlined the steps taken to gather project requirements, architect a solution, and then implement the completed deliverable. We focused on how this process can be clarified using functional thinking.</p>
<p>When gathering program requirements, the required data, input, and output should be clarified. When translating requirements into a code plan, creating a dependency graph as an intermediary step can help simplify complex designs. When testing, functions become great units to cover. By comparison, lines and lines of imperative code are almost impossible to test.</p>
<p>We will continue to develop this software project throughout the book. This first simulation deliverable will accompany the project proposal and will hopefully help our firm be selected for the contract. In the next chapter, you will receive feedback from the developers and meet your competitor.</p>

<p class="mce-root"><strong>Andrew Johnson</strong> is a software developer who has worn many hats. Professionally, he has worked on projects written in C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Haskell, OCaml, and now Rust. Most notably, he has worked as an early employee at Topsy Labs (acquired by Apple) and FiscalNote (growing rapidly). Academically, his interests are focused on the intersection between formal language processing (such as programming languages) and existing natural language programming techniques.</p>

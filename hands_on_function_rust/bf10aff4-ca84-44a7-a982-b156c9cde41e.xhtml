<p>The control flow is the most basic building block of programming. Early languages had no concept of data structures or functions, onlyÂ program flow. These control flow structures have evolved over time, from simple branches and loops to the complex value expressions available in Rust.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will start developing the project that will form the basis of all code examples in this book. The first project's requirements are introduced immediately. Then, we will provide you with actionable steps to transform project requirements into a code outline with tests. Lastly, we will develop code for the full deliverable.</p>
<p>Learning outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gathering project requirements</li>
<li>Architecting a solution based on project requirements</li>
<li>Using and recognizing expressions in functional style</li>
<li>Testing the solution with integration and unit tests</li>
</ul>

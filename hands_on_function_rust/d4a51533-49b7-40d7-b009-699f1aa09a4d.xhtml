<p>Having a stricter type system does not imply that code will have more requirements or be any more complex. Rather than strict typing, consider using the term expressive typing. Expressive typing provides more information to the compiler. This extra information allows the compiler to provide extra assistance while programming. This extra information also permits a very rich metaprogramming system. This is all in addition to the obvious benefit of safer, more robust code.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Writing fast efficient code can be something to be proud of. It also might be a waste of your employer's resources. In the performance section, we will explore how to tell the difference between the two and give best-practices, processes, and guidelines to keep your application slim.</p>
<p>In the debugging section, we offer tips to help find and resolve bugs faster. We also introduce the concept of defensive coding, which describes techniques and habits to prevent or isolate potential issues.</p>
<p>In the metaprogramming section, we explain macros and other features that are similar to macros. Rust has a fairly sophisticated metaprogramming system that allows the user or libraries to extend the language with automatic code generation or custom syntax forms.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will learn the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognizing and applying good performant code practices</li>
<li>Diagnosing and improving performance bottlenecks</li>
<li>Recognizing and applying good defensive coding practices</li>
<li>Diagnosing and resolving software bugs</li>
<li>Recognizing and applying metaprogramming techniques</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be some time before the client makes a final decision regarding negotiation and potential acceptance of your project proposal. During that time, your management has encouraged you to take this time to review your work and make preparations for integrating the elevator controller into a real elevator.</p>
<p>You do not know much about direct elevator control interfaces, and the client specifically mentioned that there may be multiple subcontractors designing each of the different elevators. Making assumptions at this point may lead to wasted effort so, instead, you decide to reconsider your code and look for opportunities to remove any assumptions.</p>
<p>Parameterization and use of trait interfaces should help achieve this goal of abstraction. During this downtime, you decide to have the team learn about parameterization and consider how it can be applied to improve this project or later projects.</p>
